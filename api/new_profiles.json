Braconid wasps (family Braconidae) usually have fewer antennal segments (up to 16) and lack vein 2m-cu in the forewing.

They parasitize a wide range of insect orders, especially Lepidoptera larvae. Braconid wasps exhibit both koinobiont and idiobiont strategies (the latter immediately immobilizing or killing the host). Braconids often target Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera, and some specialize on pest species like aphids or caterpillars."

        {
          "question": "What roles do Ichneumonid and Braconid wasps play in biological control?",
          "answer": "Both families are valuable in integrated pest management. Braconid wasps such as Cotesia glomerata and Aphidius colemani are commercially used to control caterpillars and aphids, respectively. Ichneumonid wasps like Ophion species attack noctuid moth larvae in orchards. By parasitizing and regulating pest populations, these wasps reduce the need for chemical insecticides and help maintain ecological balance in agroecosystems."
