Eggs hatch into alligator-shaped larvae that voraciously eat prey before pupating and emerging as adults."}, {"question": "How do lady beetles defend themselves against predators?", "answer": "Lady beetles use aposematic coloration to warn predators, reflex bleeding to exude toxic hemolymph, and sometimes play dead to deter or escape threats."}]}], [{"name": "Seven-spotted Lady Beetle", "species": "test", "images": ["https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/267168450/square.jpg"], "description": "fake description", "prompts": [{"question": "What is the typical habitat of the seven-spotted lady beetle?", "answer": "The seven-spotted lady beetle is commonly found in gardens, meadows, agricultural fields, and other areas with abundant plant prey such as aphids."}, {"question": "What does the seven-spotted lady beetle primarily eat?", "answer": "It primarily feeds on aphids and other small, soft-bodied insects, helping to control pest populations in its environment."}, {"question": "How does the seven-spotted lady beetle defend itself from predators?", "answer": "When threatened, it can secrete a distasteful fluid from its leg joints, a process known as reflex bleeding, and its bright coloration also serves as a warning signal."}]}], [{"name": "Small White", "species": "test", "images": ["https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/28420401/square.jpg"], "description": "fake description", "prompts": [{"question": "What plants do Small White butterflies commonly use as host plants for their caterpillars?", "answer": "Small White butterflies commonly lay their eggs on members of the Brassicaceae family, including cabbage, broccoli, kale and related cruciferous vegetables."}, {"question": "How can you distinguish a male Small White butterfly from a female in the field?", "answer": "Males have a single small black spot on each forewing, while females have two larger spots and broader black wing margins."}, {"question": "What is the typical lifecycle duration of the Small White butterfly from egg to adult?", "answer": "Under favorable conditions, the Small White completes its lifecycle in about three to four weeks, with multiple generations per year in warm climates."}]}], [{"name": "Bumble Bees", "species": "test", "images": ["https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6812/square.jpg"], "description": "fake description", "prompts": [{"question": "What features distinguish bumble bees from other bee species?", "answer": "Bumble bees are larger, fuzzier, and have rounded bodies covered in dense hair (setae). They produce a characteristic low-pitched buzz and are typically black with yellow or orange bands. Unlike honey bees, they form smaller colonies, do not store large amounts of honey, and often nest underground or in cavities."}, {"question": "How do bumble bees contribute to pollination in gardens?", "answer": "Bumble bees are highly efficient pollinators due to 'buzz pollination': they grasp flowers and vibrate their flight muscles to dislodge pollen from anthers. Their large, hairy bodies pick up and transfer more pollen than many other insects, improving fruit and seed set in plants such as tomatoes, peppers, and blueberries."}, {"question": "What threats do bumble bees face and how can we help protect them?", "answer": "Bumble bees face habitat loss, pesticide exposure, climate change, and diseases. To protect them, plant diverse native flowering species for season-long forage, provide nesting sites like undisturbed soil or abandoned rodent burrows, reduce or eliminate pesticide use, and support organic or pollinator-friendly gardening and farming practices."}]}], [{"name": "Lumbricid Earthworms", "species": "test", "images": ["https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/28279/square.jpg"], "description": "fake description", "prompts": [{"question": "What taxonomic family do Lumbricid earthworms belong to and what distinguishes them from other earthworms?", "answer": "Lumbricid earthworms belong to the family Lumbricidae.

It typically inhabits moist, well-aerated soils in gardens, fields, and forests, constructing vertical burrows that can reach depths of over a meter."}, {"question": "How do Lumbricid earthworms contribute to soil health?", "answer": "Lumbricid earthworms improve soil structure and fertility by burrowing, which enhances aeration and water infiltration, and by ingesting organic matter and mineral particles, producing nutrient-rich castings that increase soil microbial activity and plant nutrient availability."}]}], [{"name": "Ichneumonid and Braconid Wasps", "species": "test", "images": ["https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/22098248/square.jpg"], "description": "fake description", "prompts": [{"question": "What key wing venation and ovipositor characteristics distinguish ichneumonid wasps from braconid wasps?", "answer": "Ichneumonid wasps typically have a distinct 'horsehead' cell in the forewing (the discoidal cell), a well-defined second recurrent vein, and often a very long, slender ovipositor used to drill into wood or plant stems. Braconid wasps lack the horsehead cell, have a reduced or absent second recurrent vein, and generally possess a shorter, stouter ovipositor adapted for laying eggs directly into or onto host insects in exposed locations."}, {"question": "How do ichneumonid and braconid wasps differ in their host selection and parasitism strategies?", "answer": "Ichneumonid wasps are usually koinobiont endoparasitoids of Lepidoptera and other larvae, allowing the host to continue feeding while the parasitoid develops internally. Many target concealed hosts (e.g., borers) using long ovipositors. Braconid wasps exhibit a broader host range (including Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera) and include both koinobiont and idiobiont species; they often inject eggs and symbiotic viruses into hosts exposed on plant surfaces, arresting host development immediately to prevent immune responses."}, {"question": "How do ichneumonid and braconid wasps employ polydnaviruses to overcome their hosts' immune defenses?", "answer": "Both families carry lineage-specific polydnaviruses\u2014ichnoviruses in ichneumonids and bracoviruses in braconids\u2014that are injected alongside eggs. These viruses express proteins that suppress the host\u2019s cellular immunity (e.g., hemocyte activity and melanization), ensuring the wasp larva can develop internally without being encapsulated or killed by the host\u2019s defenses. Although functionally similar, the viral genomes and associated gene suites differ markedly between the two wasp families."}]}], [{"name": "Black Garden Ant", "species": "test", "images": ["https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/129815566/square.jpg"], "description": "fake description", "prompts": [{"question": "What is the primary diet of the Black Garden Ant (Lasius niger)?", "answer": "The Black Garden Ant primarily feeds on honeydew secreted by aphids and other sap-sucking insects. They also scavenge for dead insects and occasionally consume plant nectar and sweet fruits."}, {"question": "How do Black Garden Ants communicate with each other?", "answer": "Black Garden Ants communicate mainly through pheromone trails. Worker ants deposit chemical scent markers as they forage, enabling nestmates to follow the trail to food sources or back to the nest."}, {"question": "What is the social structure of a Black Garden Ant colony?", "answer": "A Black Garden Ant colony typically consists of a single queen, thousands of sterile female worker ants, and during the mating season, winged males and new queens.

They rebuild or repair sections at dusk, working for up to an hour. Roundshouldered Orbweavers construct smaller webs, typically 20\u201330 cm wide, with widely spaced spirals and a conspicuous vertical stabilimentum in the web\u2019s center. They tend to rebuild their entire web each morning before retreating to a silken shelter."}, {"question": "Which environments are preferred by Angulate versus Roundshouldered Orbweavers, and how does this influence their ecological roles?", "answer": "Angulate Orbweavers favor open meadows, scrublands, and garden edges where sunlight enhances prey visibility; they help control grasshopper and fly populations. Roundshouldered Orbweavers, by contrast, are often found along woodland margins, stone walls, and building eaves, where they capture nocturnal flying insects like moths and mosquitoes. These habitat preferences mean Angulate spiders predominantly regulate diurnal insect pests, while Roundshouldered species play a key role in nighttime pest control."}]}]]
